# OGC-IPR-Review-2021


## Introduction

**NOTE:** This repository contains a pre-public working draft of the OGC IPR Policy under review. Distribution is limited to Open Geospatial members. If you have any questions, please contact Mr. Jeff Burnett of OGC staff at jburnett@ogc.org.

This repository consists of 3 versions of the OGC IPR Policy document (in asciidoc format).

* [IPR Policy dated 19 December 2008](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-IPR-Review-2021/blob/main/ogc_ipr_policy_old.adoc)
* [DRAFT of new OGC IPR Policy](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-IPR-Review-2021/blob/main/ogc_ipr_policy_new.adoc)
* [A github Diff of the two versions](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-IPR-Review-2021/commit/2a18c73273d91160ea2f0e598d63ef3185081845)

## IPR Policy Review procedures

We ask that you review and comment only on the [DRAFT of new OGC IPR Policy](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-IPR-Review-2021/blob/main/ogc_ipr_policy_new.adoc) ONLY.

Any comments or issues should be logged in this repo [Issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-IPR-Review-2021/issues).

Within the next several weeks we will be scheduling a series of web meetings to discuss the issues logged in this repository.  The objective is to deliver a final version for OGC Board of Directors approval.  We will then give a 60-day detailed notice to OGC Membership prior to the new policy being posted and becoming effective.
