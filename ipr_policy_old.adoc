== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602248]] 1.IPR Generally

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602249]]1.1.Purpose

Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (the "OGC") has adopted this Intellectual Property Rights Policy (the "Policy") and related Policies and Procedures documents in order to minimize the possibility of inadvertent infringement of the IPR of Members and third parties using or implementing any OGC Standards and other Products.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602250]]1.2.Applicability

All Members, all Member Representatives, and all third parties attending any technical process meeting are subject to this Policy and the Policies and Procedures. Members and their Representatives are so bound under the terms of the OGC membership application, and all third parties shall be required to sign an appropriate acknowledgement of the foregoing as a precondition to participating in the OGC technical process.

_*1.3 Software Scope*_

In addition to text documents, this Policy applies to any (a) Software developed by a Standards Working Group for inclusion in a Draft Standard or Standard, and (b) any Software reference implementation of all or part of a Draft Standard or Standard developed within OGC. To the extent any OGC activity develops any other Software (e.g., tools or other stand-alone Software), the Contribution and licensing terms relating to such Software shall be as set forth in the OGC Software IP Policy and as otherwise specified in the charter of such Standards Working Group.

[width=932]
|===
h| *Term* h| *Definition*
| Call for Patents | See Section 3.4 below.
| Contribution | An affirmative and knowing contribution, in written or electronic form, with the intention that such material be considered for inclusion in a Candidate Standard or Product. A Contribution may occur: as a result of an unsolicited offer to OGC of existing technology by a Member or third party; in response to a general OGC request for proposals; or from a Participant at any time during a technical process. Contributions of Software or software for inclusion in a Reference Implementation must additionally be accompanied by a completed Software Contribution form in the form attached to this IPR Policy as Appendix D.
| Contributor | Both a Member as well as any Representative(s) of a Member, and any other person or entity making a Contribution.
| Defensive Revocation | A term in a License entitling the licensor to revoke the License if the licensee asserts a Necessary Claim under the same Standard Owned by it against any Implementer (including the Licensor), where infringement of such Necessary Claim results solely from the implementation of the Standard.
| Implementers | Those Members and non-Members who desire to use or implement a Standard or other Product defining an implementable specification.
| Innovation Program | OGC activity that manages projects advancing geospatial interoperability. The Innovation Program operates Initiatives that deliver Products.
| Innovation Program Initiative | Project managed by the Innovation Program that includes Participants from OGC member organizations and which may include financial or in-kind support from Sponsors.
| IPR | An abbreviation of "Intellectual Property Rights". As used in this Policy, IPR means claims in patents and patent applications and copyrights, but excludes trademarks and trade secrets, which are not included in a Participant and Member's licensing obligations.
| License | With respect to any Candidate Standard, either (a) an agreement to license Necessary Claim(s) thereunder that are Owned by such Member to any Member or non-Member Implementer, (i) on a nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sub licensable, worldwide, perpetual and irrevocable (except as set forth below) basis, and (ii) on RAND terms, to make, have made, use, reproduce, market, import, offer to sell and sell, and to otherwise distribute implementations of such Candidate Standard, or (b) a binding, perpetual and irrevocable (except as set forth below) commitment, in a form acceptable to OGC, not to assert such Necessary Claim(s) against any Member or non-Member Implementer of such Candidate Standard, but only to the extent that such Necessary Claim(s) is (are) necessary to implement such Candidate Standard; in each case, conditional upon such Candidate Standard becoming a Standard. For the avoidance of doubt, a license clause providing for a right of Defensive Revocation is considered to be a RAND term.
| Member | An OGC member, as defined in Article II of the OGC Bylaws.
| Necessarily Infringed | Unavoidable infringement by an implementation of a Normative Element of a Standard, there being no technically or commercially reasonable alternative way to implement that element of the Standard without resulting in such infringement.
| Necessary Claims | Those claims of a patent or patent application, throughout the world, excluding design patents and design registrations, Owned by a Member or its Related Parties now or at any future time and which would be Necessarily Infringed by implementation of a Standard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Necessary Claims shall not include any claims (i) relating to any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any implementation of a Standard but which are not themselves expressly set forth in the Standard (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or (ii) necessary for the implementation of other published standards developed elsewhere and merely referred to in the body of the Standard.
| Non-Discriminatory | Available to an Implementer under terms that are substantially identical to the terms made available to other Implementers of the same Standard under similar circumstances.
| Normative Element | Any element of a Candidate Standard or Standard that must be implemented in order to comply with such Candidate Standard or Standard. If such Candidate Standard or Standard (i) defines optional elements, or (ii) alternatives methods for implementing elements, then Normative Elements include those elements of the optional part, or alternatives for optional or other elements (as the case may be), that must be implemented if the implementation is to comply with such optional part. Examples and/or reference implementations and other standards or standards that were developed outside the SWG and which are referenced in the body of a particular Candidate Standard or Standard that may be included therein are not Normative Elements.
| OGC License | A Software license in the form of Appendix E.
| Other Work Product | Any SWG deliverable that is not a Candidate Standard or Standard. Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference to the adoption of Other Work Product shall also be deemed to apply to the adoption of an amendment to that Other Work Product as well.
| Owned | With respect to any Necessary Claim(s), the word "Owned" includes any Necessary Claim(s) that are controlled but not owned by the Member in question, provided that the Member in question is (i) entitled to sublicense such Necessary Claim(s), and (ii) would not incur an obligation to pay any royalty or other compensation to the true owner of such Necessary Claim(s) in connection with a sublicense.
| Participant | With respect to the Standards Development Process operated under OGC's Technical Committee, any Member (or, if permitted, non-Member) that enrolls to take part in a SWG that has not withdrawn from such SWG within 60 days of the date upon which that SWG was chartered, or that enrolls in a SWG after such 60 day period. .
| Policies and Procedures | Individually or collectively, as the context requires, the OGC Technical Committee Policies and Procedures.
| Product | Any output of an OGC collaborative activity in the form of documents, object or source code, registries, or presentations. "Products" include but are not limited to standards, sample code, definitions, reports, videos, user guides, scripts, etc.
| Candidate Standard | A (a) candidate OGC Standard (as defined in the Policies and Procedures document), or (b) any other Product that might, if used as intended, necessarily result in the infringement of a patent claim; in each case, prior to the adoption of such material, or other final disposition.
| RAND | Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory.
| RAND-Fee SWG | Any Standards Working Group whose charter does not specify that it is a RAND-Royalty Free SWG.
| RAND-Royalty Free SWG | A Standards Working Group whose charter specifies that no Participant may assert a right to require payment of royalties or other fees under a License to any IPR owned by such respondent that is necessary to implement the Standard developed by such Standards Working Group and ultimately adopted by the OGC.
| Reasonable | License terms relating to Necessary Claims that are not more onerous (including as to price) than could be obtained by the owner of such claims in the open market absent their inclusion in a Standard.
| Reference Implementation | A software program developed within OGC representing a compliant implementation of some or all of the Normative Elements of a Draft Standard or Standard, which has been formally adopted by the Consortium.
| Related Party | Any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the subject party. For this purpose, "control" means beneficial ownership or the right to exercise more than 50% of the voting power for the entity.
| Representative | Any individual that acts on behalf of a Member in connection with a SWG or Innovation Program Initiative, or in the completion of any form to be delivered to OGC pursuant to this IPR Policy or the Policies and Procedures.
| Software | Any combination of text listing of commands to be interpreted or to be compiled, translated, or assembled into an executable computer program; text listings that describe data structures; text listing that specifies an Application Programming Interface (API) used to interact with some executable computer service (including access from an executable computer program, library, or remotely via a telecommunications interface); binary data files; executable, object, or other intermediate executable code files; and text listings that describe the behavior of modeled devices or objects (e.g., XML, YANG, YAML files, etc.).
| Standard | A Candidate Standard that has been formally adopted by OGC. Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference to the adoption of a Candidate Standard shall also be deemed to apply to the adoption of an amendment to a Standard as well.
| Standards Working Group (SWG) | A Working Group that has been so designated pursuant to Section 3.1.1 of this IPR Policy.
| Supporter, Sponsor etc. | Do we need these Innovation Program types of roles that external organizations can play? See https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact\_id=92756#InitiativeRoles
| SWG Member | With respect to a given Standards Working Group, any Member that has enrolled in that Standards Working Group.
| Technical Committee (TC) | At any relevant time, the most senior technical committee involved in the technical process.
| Working Group (WG) | A subgroup of the TC.

== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602252]] 3.Necessary Claims

The terms of this Section 3 apply to Candidate Standards, Standards, Software and Reference Implementations, but not to Other Work Products.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602253]]3.1.Designations

At the time that a Working Group is created, the charter of that Working Group shall include the designations specified below.

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602254]]_3.1.1.Standards Working Group_

The charter shall specify whether or not it is within its charge to develop any work product that, if implemented, might include patented technology. In the event that such an activity is within the charge of such Working Group, then it shall be designated a Standards Working Group, and the terms of this Section 3, and all related provisions of the OGC Policies and Procedures, shall apply to such Working Group. In all cases where it is uncertain whether such work product might contain patented technology, the Working Group shall be designated as a Standards Working Group. If at any time during the existence of a Working Group that has not been so designated it becomes apparent to the Chair of such Working Group that patented technology may enter into its work product, then the Working Group shall be re-chartered as a Standards Working Group.

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602255]]_3.1.2.Licensing Options_

The charter of each SWG shall specify whether the SWG to be formed is a RAND-Royalty Free SWG or a RAND-Fee SWG.

The Innovation Program Initiative Call for Participation will specify license terms for all Initiative Products.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602256]]3.2.Required Commitments and Elections

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602257]]_3.2.1.Contributions_

Any Contributor making a Contribution to any SWG (regardless of its licensing designation) must commit at the time of making such Contribution that if the Candidate Standard in connection with which the Contribution is made is finally approved by OGC, the Contributor will provide a License to all patent claim(s) Owned by it that become Necessary Claim(s) by reason of its making a Contribution, without compensation and otherwise on a RAND basis, to all Implementers. Such commitment shall be made be made pursuant to a written declaration in the form of *Appendix A* to this IPR Policy.

Any Contributor making a Contribution to any Innovation Program Initiative (regardless of its licensing designation) must commit at the time of making such Contribution that upon publication or distribution of Initiative Products the Contributor will provide a License to all patent claim(s) Owned by it that become Necessary Claim(s) by reason of its making a Contribution, without compensation and otherwise on a RAND basis, to all Implementers. Such commitment shall be made be made pursuant to a written declaration in the form of *Appendix A* to this IPR Policy.

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602258]]_3.2.2.RAND-Royalty Free Standards Working Groups_

(a) Except as provided in Section 3.2.2(b) below, each Participant in a RAND-Royalty Free SWG shall automatically be committed to provide a License to all patent claims Owned by it, that become Necessary Claim(s) under the Candidate Standard referred to in the charter of such SWG, and whether or not the same have become Necessary Claims by reason of its having made a Contribution, without compensation and otherwise on a RAND basis, to all Implementers.

(b) In the event that a Participant in a RAND-Royalty Free SWG becomes aware at any time that a patent claim Owned by it, other than a Necessary Claim that the Participant is under an obligation to license pursuant to Section 3.2.1 above, would be a Necessary Claim under the Candidate Standard under development, and such Participant is not willing to provide a License to such Necessary Claim in the manner provided in Section 3.2.2(a) above, then it may avoid such obligation (but not any of its obligations under Section 3.2.1 above with respect to such Candidate Standard), subject to fulfilling the following requirements: (i) it discloses the Necessary Claim, and the portion of the Candidate Standard the implementation of which would result in the infringement of such Necessary Claim, and (ii) such disclosure is made promptly following the Participant's becoming aware that such claim may become a Necessary Claim, but in any event prior to the date upon which a final vote by the RAND-Royalty Free SWG to recommend adoption of the Candidate Standard commences.

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602259]]_3.2.3.RAND-Fee Standards Working Groups_

[type=a]
. Any Participant must, at the time that a Candidate Standard is posted for final Participant comments (and whether or not such entity is still a Participant at such time), elect one of the following:
[type=i]
.. Royalty Free RAND License. Agree that if the Candidate Standard is finally approved by OGC, the Participant will provide a License to all related Necessary Claim(s) Owned by it, without compensation and otherwise on a RAND basis, to all Implementers; or
.. RAND License with Royalty. Agree to the same terms, but reserving the right to charge a royalty or other fee on RAND terms; or
.. Withholding of License as to Identified Necessary Claims. Identify those Necessary Claims Owned by it under the Candidate Standard, in its then-current form, and the portion of the Candidate Standard that would result in such infringement, and indicate that no guarantee of license rights is being made (or that such rights will in fact be denied in some or all cases) as to such Necessary Claims. In the case of Necessary Claims under non-public patent applications, the disclosure of such claims need not be in such detail as would disclose any trade secrets.

[*Note:* A Participant may elect option i. or ii. as to some Necessary Claim(s), and this option as to other Necessary Claim(s)].

Provided, however, that an election form returned pursuant to this Section 3.2.3 by a Participant that was a Contributor shall only apply to those portions of a Candidate Standard that do not derive from such Participant's Contribution, and the Contributor's original undertakings under Section 3.2.1 above shall continue to be binding as to the balance of the Candidate Standard.

[start=2,type=a]
. No elections under this Section 3.2.3 may be required to be made in less than 45 days from the date that a Candidate Standard has been posted for final comments, and electronic notification of such posting has been sent to each Participant. All elections by Participants shall be made pursuant to a written election in the form of *Appendix B* to this IPR Policy.

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602260]]3.2.4._At_ _Technical_ _Committee Adoption of a Standard_

Any Member of the Technical Committee that desires to participate in a vote to recommend a Candidate Standard developed by a Standards Working Group to the Planning Committee for adoption must submit, when required, a completed election form in the form of*Appendix B* to this IPR Policy. No elections under this section 3.2.4 may be required to be made in less than 45 days from the date that a Candidate Standard has been posted for such vote, and electronic notification of such posting has been sent to each such Member.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602261]]3.3.Patent Calls

At the beginning of every in-person meeting, teleconference, Web conference or equivalent collaborative activity that occurs as a part of the technical process, a Patent Call shall be made. The text to be employed in making Patent Calls is set forth in *Appendix C* to this Policy.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602262]] 3.4.Sanctions for Failure to Respond or to Knowingly withhold IPR

[type=a]
. In the event that:
[type=i]
.. Any Representative knowingly and willfully fails to respond to a Patent Call with respect to all Necessary Claims that are personally known to such Representative and are Owned by such Representative or his/her employer, or
.. A Participant fails to timely return a signed and completed election form as required by Section 3.2.3 above,

Then such Participant or non-Participant Member (or the Member represented by the Representative referred to in i. above, as the case may be), shall be deemed to have elected to License all of its Necessary Claims under the Product in question, with the terms to be as set forth in Section 3.2.3(a)i or 3.2.3(a)ii above.

[start=2,type=a]
. If a non-Participant Member fails to submit a signed and completed election form as required by Section 3.2.4 together with its vote, then such non Participant Member shall be deemed to have elected to License all of its Necessary Claims under the Product in question, with the terms to be as set forth in Section 3.2.3(a)i or 3.2.3(a)ii above.
. In the event that a Participant or non-Participant Member referred to in Section 3.4(a) above shall later bring an infringement action against any Implementer with respect to a Necessary Claim(s) that was not disclosed as required, the OGC shall have no obligation to intervene, but such Implementer shall be entitled to claim protection, and to assert a complete defense against such action, under this Section 3.5 as an intended third party beneficiary.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602263]]3.5.Document Notations

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602264]]_3.5.1.Notation when no Necessary Claims have been Identified_

All Candidate Standards that are subject to public comment and all Standards shall include the following introductory language:

"Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation."

All Standards shall additionally include the following introductory language:

"THIS STANDARD IS BEING OFFERED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, AND IN PARTICULAR, ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. ANY USE OF THIS STANDARD SHALL BE MADE ENTIRELY AT THE IMPLEMENTER'S OWN RISK, AND NEITHER OGC, NOR ANY OF ITS MEMBERS OR CONTRIBUTORS, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO ANY IMPLEMENTER OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS STANDARD."

==== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602265]]3.5.2.Notation when Necessary Claims or other IPR are Identified

[type=a]
. When Necessary Claims or other IPR have been identified for Candidate Standards, or thereafter with respect to already published Standards, a notice substantially as follows shall, subject to subsection 3.5.2(b), also be included in the introductory language:

"OGC draws attention to the fact that it is claimed that compliance with this standard may involve the use of a patent or other intellectual property right (collectively, "IPR") concerning [Subject Matter] given in [Sub clause]. OGC takes no position concerning the evidence, validity or scope of this IPR.

"The holder of this IPR has assured OGC that it is willing to license all "Necessary Claims" (as defined under the OGC IPR Policy) relating to this standard it owns [and any third party Necessary Claims it has the right to sublicense] which might be infringed by any implementation of this standard to OGC and those licensees (Members and non-Members alike) desiring to implement this standard. The statement of the holder of this IPR to such effect has been filed with OGC. Information may be obtained from:

[Name of Holder of Right]

[Address]

"Attention is also drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this standard may be the subject of IPR other than those identified above. OGC shall not be responsible for identifying any or all such IPR.

"THIS STANDARD IS BEING OFFERED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, AND IN PARTICULAR, ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. ANY USE OF THIS STANDARD SHALL BE MADE ENTIRELY AT THE IMPLEMENTER'S OWN RISK, AND NEITHER OGC, NOR ANY OF ITS MEMBERS OR CONTRIBUTORS, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO ANY IMPLEMENTER OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS STANDARD."

[start=2,type=a]
. In the event that the owner of any IPR has asserted that infringement would result from the implementation of a Candidate Standard or Standard and such owner has refused to grant a license under the terms of this Policy, then the second paragraph of the above notice shall be replaced or supplemented, as appropriate, with the following:

"The holder of such IPR has refused a request by OGC that it agree to make a license available for the purpose of implementing this standard. Information may be obtained from:

[Name of Holder of Right]

[Address]"

==== 3.5.3._Notation for Other Work Product_

All draft and final Other Work Product shall bear the following notation:

"THIS MATERIAL IS BEING OFFERED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, AND IN PARTICULAR, ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. ANY USE OF THIS MATERIAL SHALL BE MADE ENTIRELY AT THE USERS OWN RISK, AND NEITHER OGC, NOR ANY OF ITS MEMBERS OR CONTRIBUTORS, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO ANY USER OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS MATERIAL."

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602266]]3.6.Patent Searches

In no event shall OGC, or any Representative, Participant or non-Participant Member be obligated to conduct any patent searches regarding any Necessary Claims that may be infringed by any implementation of a Candidate Standard or Standard.

=== [[__RefHeading___ Toc47602267]]3.7.Patent Claims Revealed After Publication

In the event that a Necessary Claim is first revealed by a Member or third party following adoption and publication of a Standard (other than a Necessary Claim subject to sanction under Section 3.4 above), such holder will be asked to License the Necessary Claim in the manner outlined in Section 3.2.3(a)(i) or 3.2.3(a)(ii) above. If such request is refused, the Standard in question shall be referred back to the Technical Committee for further consideration, as appropriate.

_*3.8 Confidential and Proprietary Information*_

For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure obligations set forth in this Section 3 shall not require a Member to violate the terms of any written non-disclosure agreement with a third party that is not (i) a Related Party of such Member, or (ii) controlled by, or under common control with, a Related Party of such Member, provided that (a) such agreement has not been entered into with the purpose, in whole or in part, of avoiding disclosure under this IPR Policy, and (b) the Member makes such disclosure as it is able to make without violating such agreement, and at minimum discloses (x) the fact that it has knowledge of a patent claim that it would otherwise be obligated to disclose, and (y) the portion of the Draft Standard that would result in infringement of such patent claim.

_*3.9 Transfers of Necessary Claims*_

(a) Each Member and Participant agrees that it will not transfer, and has not transferred, patents or published patent applications having Necessary Claims solely for the purpose of circumventing such Member or Participant's obligations under this IPR Policy.

(b) No party bound by this Policy shall transfer any patent or patent application having Necessary Claims, except to a successor that agrees in writing to (i) be bound by all commitments previously made by the immediate, or original, transferor(s) under this Policy with respect to such patent or patent application, and (ii) include the obligations set forth in this Section 3.9 in any document of transfer relating to such patent or application in the event that it later transfers the same.
